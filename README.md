JOB SEARCH APP
    Our project aims to provide a comprehensive job search platform that connects job seekers with potential employers. Our mobile application will be developed using React Native, which is a popular framework for building cross-platform mobile applications, and Firebase, which is a cloud-based platform for building mobile and web applications.
    The application will have two main components: one for job seekers and one for employers. Job seekers can create their profiles, search for jobs based on various criteria, save job postings they are interested in, and apply for job vacancies directly through the application. Employers, on the other hand, can create their company profiles, post job vacancies, search for potential candidates, and manage job applications.
    The application will use Firebase Authentication for user authentication and authorization, allowing job seekers and employers to securely access their accounts. Firebase Realtime Database will be used to store and retrieve data related to job postings, job applications, and user profiles.
    We believe that our job search platform will provide a valuable service to both job seekers and employers, and we are excited to develop this application using React Native and Firebase.

Getting Started
To get started with this app, you will need to have Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager) installed on your computer. You can download the latest version of Node.js and npm from the official website: https://nodejs.org

Mac
1. Install Xcode and Command Line Tools

Watchman is a tool that can speed up the build process in React Native. You can install it using Homebrew, a package manager for macOS:

brew install watchman

3. Install React Native CLI
You can install the React Native CLI (Command Line Interface) using npm:

npm install -g react-native-cli

4. Install Dependencies
